Singular Coefficient Matrix
A square matrix A is singular if it does not have linearly independent columns. If A is singular, the solution to Ax = b either does not exist, or is not unique. The backslash operator, A\b, issues a warning if A is nearly singular and raises an error condition if it detects exact singularity.

If A is singular and Ax = b has a solution, you can find a particular solution that is not unique, by typing

P = pinv(A)*b
P is a pseudoinverse of A. If Ax = b does not have an exact solution, pinv(A) returns a least-squares solution.

For example:

A = [ 1     3     7
     -1     4     4
      1    10    18 ]
is singular, as you can verify by typing

rank(A)

ans =

     2
Since A is not full rank, it has some singular values equal to zero.

Note:   For information about using pinv to solve systems with rectangular coefficient matrices, see Pseudoinverses.
Exact Solutions.  For b =[5;2;12], the equation Ax = b has an exact solution, given by

pinv(A)*b

ans =
    0.3850
   -0.1103
    0.7066
Verify that pinv(A)*b is an exact solution by typing

A*pinv(A)*b

ans =
    5.0000
    2.0000
   12.0000
